### R1D1 20 July 2020
**Today's:** Started from codecademy, learn javascript lesson part modules at codecademy.
**Thought:** modules are reusable pieces of code that can be exported a program and imported a program to another program

### R1D2 21 July 2020
**Today's:** I just finished lesson about intermediate modules javascript at codecademy.
**Thought:** ES6 make an easier syntax for export and import in javascript. 
    1. export default: for export javasript object, function, and primitives data types
    2. export: use for export data in variable. example: export let myWork
    3. as: named export can be alliased using keyword as. example: export myWork as myW
    4. import: is a keyword for import any object, function or data type.
